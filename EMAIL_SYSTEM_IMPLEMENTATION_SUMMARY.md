## What's Needed to Enable Email Delivery

### Single Step Required: Configure Gmail Credentials

**Choose ONE method below:**

#### Method 1: Environment Variables (RECOMMENDED)

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:GMAIL_USER = "mustlms@gmail.com"  # Your Gmail address
$env:GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD = "abcdefghijklmnop"  # 16-char app password

# Start backend
cd backend
npm start
```

#### Method 2: Edit server.js

File: `backend/server.js`, Lines 34-43

```javascript
let CURRENT_ADMIN_EMAIL = 'mustlms@gmail.com';
const EMAIL_CONFIG = {
  host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: 'mustlms@gmail.com',
    pass: 'abcdefghijklmnop'
  }
};
```

### How to Get App Password

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable "2-Step Verification"
3. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Select: Mail + Other (MUST LMS)
5. Generate password (16 characters with spaces)
6. Remove spaces: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` → `abcdefghijklmnop`

---

## How It Works - User Flow

```
1. User visits login page
2. Clicks "Forgot Password"
3. Enters email address
4. ✅ System validates email format
5. ✅ System checks email exists in database
6. User clicks "Send Reset Code"
7. ✅ Backend generates 8-char code
8. ✅ Code saved in database (15 min expiry)
9. 📧 EMAIL SENT TO USER (if Gmail configured)
   - From: MUST LMS <mustlms@gmail.com>
   - To: user@example.com
   - Subject: Password Reset Code - MUST LMS
   - Body: Reset code (large text), 15-min expiry
10. User receives email in Gmail inbox
11. User enters code in form
12. ✅ Code verified (not expired, not used)
13. User sets new password
14. ✅ Password updated in database
15. ✅ Reset code marked as "used"
16. User can login with new password
```

## Current System State

### ✅ Working Without Gmail Config
- Email verification
- Code generation
- Code storage
- Code expiration (15 minutes)
- Password validation
- Password update
- One-time use enforcement

### ⏳ Waiting for Gmail Config
- **Email delivery to users**
- That's the only missing piece!
