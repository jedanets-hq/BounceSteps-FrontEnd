## 📊 DETAILED FINDINGS

### Issue #1: Academic Settings

**Root Cause Found:**
```
Frontend state variables were not initialized with 
loaded academic year/semester data on page refresh,
causing dropdown selects to lose their values.
```

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `selectedActiveYearId` state
- Added `selectedActiveSemesterId` state
- Added `selectedYearForDisplay` state
- Modified `useEffect` to populate these states
- Modified `handleAddAcademicYear` to update display state

**Files Modified:**
- `admin-system/src/pages/AcademicSettings.tsx`

**Lines Changed:**
- Lines 46-52: New state declarations
- Lines 53-94: Updated useEffect
- Lines 103-139: Updated handleAddAcademicYear

---

### Issue #2: Reports Total Students

**Root Cause Found:**
```
Reports component was making API calls without 
Authorization header, causing 401 Unauthorized errors.
Backend requires JWT token for /api/students endpoint.
```

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `getAuthToken()` helper function
- Added `fetchWithAuth()` helper function
- Modified `useEffect` to use authenticated fetch
- Added proper error handling with default values
- Added `user_type=admin` query parameter

**Files Modified:**
- `admin-system/src/pages/Reports.tsx`

**Lines Changed:**
- Lines 16-33: New auth helper functions
- Lines 37-95: Updated useEffect with auth

## 📞 SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Academic Settings Dropdown Still Shows "Select..."
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify backend `/api/academic-periods/active` is working
3. Ensure at least one academic year exists in database
4. Try clearing browser cache and refresh

### If Reports Still Shows 0
1. Verify you're logged in as Admin
2. Check localStorage.getItem('currentUser') returns token
3. Check Network tab - ensure `/api/students?user_type=admin` returns 200 OK
4. Verify students table has data in database

### Both Issues
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Restart browser if needed
