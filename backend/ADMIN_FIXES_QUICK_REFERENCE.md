# Admin Portal Fixes - Quick Reference

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Student Count (0 → Actual Number)
**Where**: Lecturer Information → View Details → Programs  
**Before**: Showed 0 students  
**After**: Shows actual count of active students  

### 2. Student Status (Always Active → Real Status)
**Where**: Student Information → Student List  
**Before**: All students showed "Active"  
**After**: Shows "Inactive" until student completes registration

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### File 1: `LecturerInformation.tsx` (Line 167-171)
```typescript
// Added: && student.is_active === true
actualStudentCount = allStudents.filter((student: any) => 
  student.course_id === program.course_id && student.is_active === true
).length;
```

### File 2: `StudentInformation.tsx` (Line 187-188)
```typescript
// Changed from: status: 'Active' as const,
// Changed to:
status: (student.is_active === true ? 'Active' : 'Inactive') as 'Active' | 'Inactive',
```
