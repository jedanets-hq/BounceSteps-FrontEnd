# 🧪 FLEXIBLE ASSESSMENT GRADING SYSTEM - TESTING GUIDE

## 📋 **TESTING WORKFLOW OVERVIEW**

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the flexible assessment grading system implementation.

---

## 🎯 **1. AUTO-GRADING FUNCTIONALITY TEST**

### **Test Scenario 1: Mixed Question Assessment with Auto-Grade ON**

#### **Setup:**
1. **Lecturer Portal** → Assessment → Create Assessment
2. **Enable Auto-Grade**: ✅ Check "Auto-grade submissions"
3. **Add Mixed Questions**:
   - 2x Multiple Choice (5 points each)
   - 2x True/False (3 points each) 
   - 2x Short Answer (7 points each)
4. **Total Points**: 30 points
5. **Publish Assessment**

#### **Expected Behavior:**
- Auto-gradable questions (MC + T/F) = 16 points max
- Manual questions (Short Answer) = 14 points max
- Student submission should auto-score MC/T/F immediately
- Short answer questions remain at 0 points (awaiting manual grading)

#### **Testing Steps:**
```
1. Student takes assessment
2. Submit answers (mix of correct/incorrect)
3. Check Assessment Results in lecturer portal
4. Verify auto-graded score shows immediately
5. Verify short-answer questions show 0 points
6. Manually grade short-answer questions
7. Verify total score = auto-graded + manual scores
```

---

## 🎯 **2. MANUAL GRADING WORKFLOW TEST**

### **Test Scenario 2: Full Manual Grading with Auto-Grade OFF**

#### **Setup:**
1. **Lecturer Portal** → Assessment → Create Assessment
2. **Disable Auto-Grade**: ❌ Uncheck "Auto-grade submissions"
3. **Add Mixed Questions** (same as above)
4. **Publish Assessment**

#### **Expected Behavior:**
- ALL questions require manual grading
- No automatic scoring regardless of question type
- All submissions show "submitted" status
- Lecturer must grade each question manually

#### **Testing Steps:**
```
1. Student takes assessment
2. Submit answers
3. Check Assessment Results - should show "submitted" status
4. Click "Grade" button for individual student
5. Manually assign scores to ALL questions (including MC/T/F)
6. Save grades
7. Verify total score reflects manual grading
```

## 🎯 **3. INDIVIDUAL VS BULK GRADING TEST**

### **Test Scenario 3: Multiple Student Submissions**

#### **Setup:**
1. **Create assessment** with auto-grade ON
2. **Multiple students** submit (use different browsers/accounts)
3. **Test both grading approaches**

#### **Individual Grading:**
```
1. Assessment Results → Select student → "Grade" button
2. Review each question and student answer
3. Adjust auto-graded scores if needed
4. Add feedback to questions
5. Save grades
6. Verify student-specific grading
```

#### **Bulk Auto-Grading:**
```
1. Assessment Results → "Auto Grade All" button
2. Confirm bulk grading action
3. Verify all auto-gradable questions scored
4. Check that short-answer questions remain ungraded
5. Individually grade remaining questions as needed
```

## 🎯 **4. REAL-TIME SCHEDULING TEST**

### **Test Scenario 4: Scheduled Assessment Auto-Start**

#### **Setup:**
1. **Create assessment** with scheduled date/time
2. **Set schedule** for 2-3 minutes in the future
3. **Student waits** on Take Assessment page

#### **Expected Behavior:**
```
1. Assessment shows "Scheduled Assessment" warning
2. At scheduled time (±1 minute), auto-start alert appears
3. Assessment begins automatically
4. Timer calculates from scheduled start time
5. Late students get warning with remaining time
6. Expired assessments show expiry message
```

#### **Testing Steps:**
```
1. Create assessment scheduled for immediate future
2. Student opens Take Assessment page
3. Wait for scheduled time
4. Verify auto-start functionality
5. Test late student scenario (join after scheduled time)
6. Test expired assessment scenario
```

## 🎯 **5. ASSIGNMENT CATEGORY INTEGRATION TEST**

### **Test Scenario 5: Results Publication Workflow**

#### **Complete Workflow:**
```
Assessment Creation → Student Submission → Grading → Results Publication → Student Assignment View
```

#### **Testing Steps:**
```
1. LECTURER: Create and publish assessment
2. STUDENT: Take assessment and submit
3. LECTURER: Grade submissions (auto/manual)
4. LECTURER: Click "Submit Results to Students"
5. STUDENT: Check Assignment category
6. VERIFY: Graded assessment appears in Assignment section
7. VERIFY: Score, percentage, grade, feedback visible
8. VERIFY: Assessment no longer in "Take Assessment"
```

---

## 🎯 **6. DATABASE INTEGRATION TEST**

### **Test Scenario 6: Data Persistence and API Integration**

#### **Backend API Testing:**
```
1. POST /api/assessments - Create assessment
2. GET /api/student-assessments - Student view
3. POST /api/assessment-submissions - Submit assessment  
4. POST /api/manual-grade-submission - Manual grading
5. POST /api/auto-grade-all/:id - Bulk auto-grading
6. POST /api/submit-results-to-students/:id - Publish results
7. GET /api/student-graded-assessments - Assignment view
```

#### **Database Verification:**
```
1. Check assessments table for proper data storage
2. Verify assessment_submissions table structure
3. Confirm manual_scores and feedback JSONB storage
4. Test published_to_students flag functionality
5. Verify grading timestamps (graded_at, published_at)
```

console.log('Grading Scores:', gradingScores);

// Check API responses
console.log('API Response:', response);
```

### **Backend Logging:**
