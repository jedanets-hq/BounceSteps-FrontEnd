# Assignment Visibility and Program Filtering Fix

## Matatizo Yaliyokuwa Yakitokea (Problems That Were Occurring)

### 1. **Assignments Zinaonekana Kwenye Notifications Lakini Sio Kwenye Assignment Category**
   - Assignments zilikuwa zinaonekana kwenye notifications
   - Lakini hazikuonekana kwenye assignment category ya student portal
   - Hii ilikuwa inasababisha confusion kwa wanafunzi

### 2. **Assignments Zinaenda Kwa Wanafunzi Wasiohusika**
   - Lecturer akisend assignment kwa program fulani (e.g., "Computer Science")
   - Assignment ilikuwa inaenda hadi kwa wanafunzi wa programs nyingine (e.g., "Information Technology")
   - Hii ilikuwa ni security issue kubwa na data leakage

## Chanzo cha Tatizo (Root Cause)

### Backend Filtering Issue
Kwenye `backend/server.js` line 2591-2614, kulikuwa na **partial matching logic** ambayo ilikuwa too loose:

```javascript
// OLD CODE (PROBLEMATIC)
// Contains match
if (programLower.includes(assessmentProgramLower) || assessmentProgramLower.includes(programLower)) {
  console.log(`✅ Assessment "${assessment.title}" - Partial program match: ${assessment.program_name}`);
  return true;
}

// Word-based matching
const programWords = programLower.split(/\s+/);
const assessmentWords = assessmentProgramLower.split(/\s+/);
const commonWords = programWords.filter(word => 
  word.length > 3 && assessmentWords.includes(word)
);

if (commonWords.length >= 2) {
  console.log(`✅ Assessment "${assessment.title}" - Word match: ${assessment.program_name}`);
  return true;
}
```

**Tatizo:** Hii logic ilikuwa inaruhusu:
- "Computer Science" kumatch na "Information Technology" kama wana words zinazofanana
- "Business Administration" kumatch na "Business Management"
- Cross-program leakage

## Suluhisho (Solution)

### ✅ Fix 1: Backend Exact Matching Only

**File:** `backend/server.js` (lines 2591-2614)

**Changes Made:**
```javascript
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
// Filter assessments based on student's programs - EXACT MATCH ONLY
filteredAssessments = result.rows.filter(assessment => {
  // Check if assessment program matches any of student's programs
  const programMatch = studentPrograms.some(program => {
    if (!program || !assessment.program_name) return false;
    
    const programLower = program.toLowerCase().trim();
    const assessmentProgramLower = assessment.program_name.toLowerCase().trim();
    
    // ONLY exact match - prevents cross-program leakage
    if (programLower === assessmentProgramLower) {
      console.log(`✅ Assessment "${assessment.title}" - Exact program match: ${assessment.program_name}`);
      return true;
    }
    
    return false;
  });
  
  if (!programMatch) {
    console.log(`❌ Assessment "${assessment.title}" - No program match: ${assessment.program_name}`);
  }
  
  return programMatch;
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Exact matching only** - program name lazima ifanane kabisa
- ✅ **No partial matching** - prevents cross-program leakage
- ✅ **No word-based matching** - prevents false positives
- ✅ **Case-insensitive** - "Computer Science" = "computer science"
- ✅ **Whitespace trimmed** - handles extra spaces

### ✅ Fix 2: Assignment Endpoint Already Secure

**File:** `backend/server.js` (lines 2195-2330)

The `/api/assignments` endpoint was already using exact matching:
```javascript
// ALREADY CORRECT - ONLY exact match
if (programLower === assignmentProgramLower) {
  console.log(`   ✅ MATCH via exact program name`);
  return true;
}
```

**Additional Security:**
- Uses `program_id` matching as priority (most precise)
- Falls back to exact program name matching
- No partial or word-based matching

### ✅ Fix 3: Frontend Already Correct

**File:** `student-system/src/pages/StudentAssignments.tsx`

The frontend component is already properly configured:
- ✅ Fetches from `/api/assessments?status=published&student_username=...`
- ✅ Fetches from `/api/assignments?student_username=...`
- ✅ Backend handles ALL filtering - no frontend filtering needed
- ✅ Combines both assessment and assignment types
- ✅ Displays in the "Assignments" category

## Jinsi Inavyofanya Kazi Sasa (How It Works Now)

### 1. **Student Anapoopen Assignment Category**
```
Student Portal → Assignments Category → StudentAssignments.tsx
                                      ↓
                        Fetch from Backend with student_username
                                      ↓
                        Backend filters by EXACT program match
                                      ↓
                        Returns ONLY student's assignments
                                      ↓
                        Display in UI
```

### 2. **Lecturer Anaposend Assignment**
```
Lecturer creates assignment for "Computer Science"
                ↓
Backend saves with program_name = "Computer Science"
                ↓
Student with program "Computer Science" → ✅ SEES assignment
Student with program "Information Technology" → ❌ DOESN'T SEE
Student with program "Business Administration" → ❌ DOESN'T SEE
```

### 3. **Program Matching Logic**
```
Assignment Program: "Computer Science"
Student Programs: ["Computer Science", "Data Structures"]

Check 1: "computer science" === "computer science" → ✅ MATCH
Result: Assignment visible to student

---

Assignment Program: "Computer Science"
Student Programs: ["Information Technology", "Networking"]

Check 1: "computer science" === "information technology" → ❌ NO MATCH
Check 2: "computer science" === "networking" → ❌ NO MATCH
Result: Assignment NOT visible to student
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Assignment Visibility in Category
1. Login as student
2. Navigate to "Assignments" category
3. ✅ Verify assignments for your program are visible
4. ✅ Verify assignments match those in notifications

### Test 2: Program Isolation
1. Create assignment for "Computer Science" as lecturer
2. Login as "Computer Science" student → ✅ Should see assignment
3. Login as "Information Technology" student → ❌ Should NOT see assignment
4. Login as "Business Administration" student → ❌ Should NOT see assignment

### Test 3: Case Sensitivity
1. Create assignment with program "Computer Science"
2. Student with program "computer science" → ✅ Should see (case-insensitive)
3. Student with program "COMPUTER SCIENCE" → ✅ Should see (case-insensitive)

### Test 4: Exact Matching
1. Create assignment for "Computer Science"
2. Student with "Computer" only → ❌ Should NOT see (not exact match)
3. Student with "Science" only → ❌ Should NOT see (not exact match)
4. Student with "Computer Science Engineering" → ❌ Should NOT see (not exact match)

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Program Name Consistency
**CRITICAL:** Program names MUST be EXACTLY the same between:
- Lecturer's assignment creation
- Student's enrolled programs
- Database program records

**Example:**
```
✅ CORRECT:
Lecturer creates: "Computer Science"
Student enrolled: "Computer Science"
Result: Match!

❌ WRONG:
Lecturer creates: "Computer Science"
Student enrolled: "Computer Science Engineering"
Result: No match!

❌ WRONG:
Lecturer creates: "Comp Sci"
Student enrolled: "Computer Science"
Result: No match!
```

### 🔧 If Assignments Still Not Showing

1. **Check Program Names:**
   ```sql
   -- Check student's programs
   SELECT p.name FROM programs p
   JOIN students s ON s.course_id = p.course_id
   WHERE s.registration_number = 'STUDENT_REG_NUMBER';
   
   -- Check assignment program
   SELECT program_name FROM assignments WHERE id = ASSIGNMENT_ID;
   ```

2. **Verify Exact Match:**
   - Program names must be EXACTLY the same
   - Check for extra spaces, different capitalization
   - Use trim() and toLowerCase() for comparison

3. **Check Backend Logs:**
   ```
   Look for:
   "✅ MATCH via exact program name"
   "❌ NO MATCH - Assignment not visible to this student"
   ```
