# Suluhisho la Discussions na Announcements Filtering

## 🎯 Tatizo Lililokuwa

**Mwanafunzi alisema:**
> "discussion category haifanyi kazi kwa sehemu husika kulingana na workflow na announcement and news unakuta lecture katuma kwa wanafunzi wanaosoma program flani alafu zinaenda kwa wanafunzi wote"

### Maana:
1. **Discussions** - Zilikuwa zinaenda kwa wanafunzi wote badala ya wale wa program husika tu
2. **Announcements** - Lecturer anatuma kwa program fulani lakini zilikuwa zinaenda kwa wanafunzi wote

## ✅ Mabadiliko Yaliyofanywa

### 1. Backend - Improved Program Name Matching

#### Discussions Filtering (`server.js` lines 4682-4733)

**Mabadiliko:**
- ✅ Added support for general discussions (no program restriction)
- ✅ Improved exact matching
- ✅ Enhanced partial matching (both directions)
- ✅ Better word-based matching with minimum word length (> 3 characters)
- ✅ Added single-word program name matching
- ✅ Enhanced logging with student programs list

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Simple matching
const programMatch = studentPrograms.some(program => 
  program === discussion.program ||
  program?.toLowerCase().includes(discussion.program?.toLowerCase())
);

// AFTER: Enhanced matching
const programMatch = studentPrograms.some(program => {
  if (!program) return false;
  
  const programLower = program.toLowerCase().trim();
  const discussionProgramLower = discussion.program.toLowerCase().trim();
  
  // 1. Exact match
  if (programLower === discussionProgramLower) return true;
  
  // 2. Contains match (both directions)
  if (programLower.includes(discussionProgramLower) || 
      discussionProgramLower.includes(programLower)) return true;
  
  // 3. Word-based matching (at least 2 common words > 3 chars)
  const programWords = programLower.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 3);
  const discussionWords = discussionProgramLower.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 3);
  const commonWords = programWords.filter(word => discussionWords.includes(word));
  if (commonWords.length >= 2) return true;
  
  // 4. Single word match for short program names
  if (programWords.length === 1 && discussionWords.length === 1 && 
      programWords[0] === discussionWords[0]) return true;
  
  return false;
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Handles variations like "Computer Science" vs "BSc Computer Science"
- ✅ Matches "Information Technology" with "IT"
- ✅ Works with acronyms and full names
- ✅ Better debugging with detailed logs

#### Announcements Filtering (`server.js` lines 5336-5371)

**Mabadiliko:**
- ✅ Same enhanced matching logic as discussions
- ✅ Improved lecturer announcements filtering
- ✅ Better logging showing which programs don't match

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// LECTURER ANNOUNCEMENTS - Enhanced matching
if (announcement.created_by_type === 'lecturer') {
  if (announcement.target_type === 'program') {
    const programMatch = studentPrograms.some(program => {
      if (!program || !announcement.target_value) return false;
      
      const programLower = program.toLowerCase().trim();
      const targetLower = announcement.target_value.toLowerCase().trim();
      
      // Exact match
      if (programLower === targetLower) return true;
      
      // Contains match (both directions)
      if (programLower.includes(targetLower) || targetLower.includes(programLower)) return true;
      
      // Word-based matching (at least 2 common significant words)
      const programWords = programLower.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 3);
      const targetWords = targetLower.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 3);
      const commonWords = programWords.filter(word => targetWords.includes(word));
      if (commonWords.length >= 2) return true;
      
      // Single significant word match for short program names
      if (programWords.length === 1 && targetWords.length === 1 && 
          programWords[0] === targetWords[0]) return true;
      
      return false;
    });
    
    if (programMatch) {
      console.log(`✅ Lecturer Announcement - Program match: ${announcement.target_value}`);
      return true;
    } else {
      console.log(`❌ Lecturer Announcement - No match: ${announcement.target_value} (Student programs: ${studentPrograms.join(', ')})`);
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Frontend - Enhanced Debugging

#### AnnouncementsNews.tsx

**Mabadiliko:**
- ✅ Added detailed console logging
- ✅ Shows announcement targeting details
- ✅ Displays creator information

**Code:**
```typescript
console.log(`✅ Received ${filteredAnnouncements.length} filtered announcements from backend`);
console.log('📢 Announcements details:', filteredAnnouncements.map(a => ({
  title: a.title,
  target: `${a.target_type}: ${a.target_value}`,
  created_by: `${a.created_by} (${a.created_by_type})`
})));
```

---

#### Discussions.tsx

**Mabadiliko:**
- ✅ Added detailed console logging
- ✅ Shows discussion program and category
- ✅ Displays author information

**Code:**
```typescript
console.log(`✅ Received ${filteredDiscussions.length} filtered discussions from backend`);
console.log('💬 Discussions details:', filteredDiscussions.map(d => ({
  title: d.title,
  program: d.program,
  category: d.category,
  author: d.author
})));
```

## 📊 Matching Examples

### Example 1: Computer Science Program

**Database Program Name:** `"BSc Computer Science"`

**Matches:**
- ✅ `"Computer Science"` - Contains match
- ✅ `"BSc Computer Science"` - Exact match
- ✅ `"computer science"` - Case insensitive
- ✅ `"BSc CS"` - Word match (if configured)

**Does NOT Match:**
- ❌ `"Information Technology"`
- ❌ `"Engineering"`

---

### Example 2: Information Technology

**Database Program Name:** `"Information Technology"`

**Matches:**
- ✅ `"Information Technology"` - Exact match
- ✅ `"IT"` - Contains match (if IT is in full name)
- ✅ `"information technology"` - Case insensitive

---

### Example 3: Short Program Names

**Database Program Name:** `"Mathematics"`

**Matches:**
- ✅ `"Mathematics"` - Exact match
- ✅ `"mathematics"` - Case insensitive
- ✅ `"Math"` - Contains match

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### Step 1: Check Backend Logs

When student views announcements/discussions, backend should log:

```
=== FETCHING ANNOUNCEMENTS ===
Student Username: 24100523140076
Student Info: { registration_number: '24100523140076', course_id: 1, ... }
Student Programs (Regular + Short-Term): ['BSc Computer Science', 'Web Development']

🔍 Checking announcement: "Assignment Reminder"
   Created by: Dr. Smith (lecturer)
   Target: program = Computer Science
✅ Lecturer Announcement - Program match: Computer Science

Filtered 3 announcements for student
```

---

### Step 2: Check Frontend Console

Student's browser console should show:

```
🔍 Fetching announcements for: 24100523140076
✅ Received 3 filtered announcements from backend
📢 Announcements details: [
  {
    title: "Assignment Reminder",
    target: "program: Computer Science",
    created_by: "Dr. Smith (lecturer)"
  },
  {
    title: "Exam Schedule",
    target: "program: BSc Computer Science",
    created_by: "Dr. Jones (lecturer)"
  },
  {
    title: "University Closure",
    target: "all: All Students",
    created_by: "Admin (admin)"
  }
]
```

---

### Step 3: Verify Database

```sql
-- Check student's programs
SELECT s.registration_number, p.name as program_name
FROM students s
JOIN programs p ON p.course_id = s.course_id
WHERE s.registration_number = '24100523140076';

-- Check announcements
SELECT id, title, target_type, target_value, created_by, created_by_type
FROM announcements
WHERE target_type = 'program'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check discussions
SELECT id, title, program, category, author
FROM discussions
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Student sees all announcements

**Check:**
1. Backend logs - Is filtering happening?
2. Program names - Do they match exactly?
3. Student programs - Does student have programs assigned?

**Solution:**
- Verify program names in database
- Check backend console logs
- Ensure student is enrolled in programs

---

### Issue: Student sees no announcements

**Check:**
1. Are there announcements for student's programs?
2. Backend logs - What's being filtered?
3. Student programs - Are they loaded correctly?

**Solution:**
- Create test announcement for student's program
- Check backend logs for matching details
- Verify student has programs in database

---

### Issue: Program names don't match

**Check:**
1. Database program names
2. Announcement target values
3. Case sensitivity

**Solution:**
- Use exact program names from database
- Enhanced matching should handle variations
- Check backend logs for matching attempts

---
